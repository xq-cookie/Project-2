# **Project 2 — ADI & Gini Analysis**

This project examines the relationship between the **Area Deprivation Index (ADI)** at the county level and the **Gini Index** (state-level income inequality) across the United States. The notebook performs data cleaning, merging, and visualization to explore how socioeconomic deprivation and inequality vary across states.
